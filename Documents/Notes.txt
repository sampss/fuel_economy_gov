Used meta_data_cleanup to modify the metadata for the vehicles.csv to be more readable and be able to be added to a dataframe if needed.

nan appears to be equivalent of gasoline fuel type in the atvtype field


List of possible needed columns. see columns to keep.txt

I need to verify what vehicle classes are available for EVs to perform the base comparisons among similar vehicle sizes.

Can look at fuel types available as time progresses.  Possibly fuel prices over the years.



fuelType column needs to be cleaned up as we are only looking at specific fuel types and electric.
Regular, Premium, Diesel, CNG, Gasoline or natural gas, Gasoline or E85, Electricity, Gasoline or propane, Premium or E85, Midgrade, Premium Gas or Electricity, Regular Gas and Electricity, Premium and Electricity, Regular Gas or Electricity, Hydrogen, 

prety sure this will be the varients we are looking for.
Regular, Premium, Electricity, Premium Gas or Electricity, Regular Gas and Electricity, Premium and Electricity, Regular Gas or Electricity,
