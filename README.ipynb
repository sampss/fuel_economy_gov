    "- fuelType and fuelType1:  Contained the same information for the single fuel vehicles.  Removed fuelType changed name of fuelType1 to fuel_type\n",

    "- Renamed c240Dscr to charger_descript_240, charge240 to charge_hours_240, co2 to co2, fuelType1 to fuel_type, comb08 to comb_MPG_MPGe, fuelCost08 to est_ann_fuel_cost, combE to comb_kWh_100miles, feScore to epa_FuelEcon_score, ghgScore to greenhouse_Gas_Score, barrels08 to est_petro_cons, youSaveSpend to 5yr_SaveSpend, baseModel to base_Model, atvType to base_fuel_type\n",
    "- Cleaned up second data set by creating a column key that allows me to merge with existing dataset. Needed to generate the key in both tables and left merge with existing data.\n",
    "- before merging I needed to average the sales that had the same key in the second dataset and aggregate on the key, creating a column that counted the rows merged as number of sales.\n",
    "- I then created two additional data columns base on standard current prices of fuel and electricity - dollars_to_work, co2_to_work\n",
    "- Given how small the values would be for 1 mile I calculated dollars to work on a 20 mile round trip.\n",
    "- I chose to use the same standard to calculate Co2 to work - shows Co2 produced using Coal to charge enouch to travel the 20 miles."

    "- Created a graph showing \"Fuel Efficiency Trends for Gasoline Vehicles\" over the years.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - As a quick reference, it looks like on average fuel efficiency has improved over time.\n",
    "    - Only two vehicle classed were able to get over 20 MPG in the 80s, now several vehicle classes have broken 20 MPG\n",
    "\n",
    "- Created a bar chart comparing how much it costs to drive round trip estimated at current energy prices and 20 miles to work and home.  Based on Vehicle Class.\n",
    "    - It is significantly cheaper to drive an electric vehicle to work\n",
    "    - Gasoline is the most expensive fuel to use.\n",
    "    - Using a hybrid reduces your gasoline cost by approximately 1/3.\n",
    "    - Electric will cost you 1/3 as much to drive to work and home on average and is typically under 1 dollar.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Created a bar chart to compare graph we are comparing how clean it is to drive an electric vehicle vs. gasolin and hybrids.\n",
    "    - The electricity for this chart is assumed to be produced soley by coal.\n",
    "    - After looking over the data, IF the electricity used to charge an EV was produced with ONLY coal, then the EV would only be sleightly cleaner to drive.\n",
    "    - With the exception of a few EVs on average it appears that EVs produce 1-3 lbs less Co2 to travel 20 miles than a gasoline engine would produce traveling the same distance.\n",
    "    - There are three odd cases where the EVs are producing more Co2. \n",
    "    - This is ignoring the fact that much of the electricity locally is produced by hydroelectricity which would reduce the over all Co2 rating for EVs\n",
    "\n",
    "- Created a final bar chart comparing Sales Values Between EV, Gasoline and Hybrid Cars.\n",
    "    - I had limited sales data.\n",
    "    - More complete Sales data would have been nice.\n",
    "    - Given the limited sales data available it shows that EVs are a small portion of the market.\n",
    "    - Hybrids seem to be doing well, although they on average run more expensive than Gasoline Engines.\n",
    "    - The cost of EVs is highly dependant on the Vehicle Class.  Typically comparable to Gasoline however they can be extremely expensive.\n",
    "    - Gasoline and Hybrids still hold a larger share of the market compared to EVs."
