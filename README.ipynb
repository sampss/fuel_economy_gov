    "**MPGe (Miles Per Gallon equivalent)** is a measure used to compare the energy consumption of electric and alternative fuel vehicles with that of traditional gasoline vehicles. The formula for calculating MPGe is based on the energy content of a gallon of gasoline, which is approximately 33.7 kilowatt-hours (kWh) of electricity.\n",

    "- **Energy Content Equivalency:** The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) established that 33.7 kWh of electricity is equivalent to one gallon of gasoline.\n",
    "- **Vehicle Efficiency:** To determine the MPGe of an electric vehicle, you need to know how far the vehicle can travel on 33.7 kWh of electricity.\n",
