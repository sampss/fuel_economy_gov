    "## Data Cleanup Decisions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Column Removal and Adjustments:**\n",
    "   - **CO2:** Removed `co2TailpipGPM` after verifying it contained the same data as the `co2` column.\n",
    "   - **Fuel Type Columns:** Found that `fuelType` and `fuelType1` held identical information for single-fuel vehicles. Removed `fuelType` and renamed `fuelType1` to `fuel_type`.\n",
    "   - **Unnecessary Columns:** Dropped the following unused columns:  \n",
    "     `'mfrCode', 'evMotor', 'sCharger', 'tCharger', 'trans_dscr', 'rangeHwy', 'rangeCity', 'mpgData', 'eng_dscr', 'engId', 'cityE', 'charge240b'`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Column Renaming:**\n",
    "   - Renamed columns to improve readability and maintain consistency:  \n",
    "     - `c240Dscr` → `charger_descript_240`  \n",
    "     - `charge240` → `charge_hours_240`  \n",
    "     - `co2` → `co2` (retained original name for clarity)  \n",
    "     - `fuelType1` → `fuel_type`  \n",
    "     - `comb08` → `comb_MPG_MPGe`  \n",
    "     - `fuelCost08` → `est_ann_fuel_cost`  \n",
    "     - `combE` → `comb_kWh_100miles`  \n",
    "     - `feScore` → `epa_FuelEcon_score`  \n",
    "     - `ghgScore` → `greenhouse_Gas_Score`  \n",
    "     - `barrels08` → `est_petro_cons`  \n",
    "     - `youSaveSpend` → `5yr_SaveSpend`  \n",
    "     - `baseModel` → `base_Model`  \n",
    "     - `atvType` → `base_fuel_type`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Second Dataset Cleanup:**\n",
    "   - Generated a column key to merge the second dataset with the existing dataset. Created keys in both tables for seamless merging.\n",
    "   - Prior to merging, averaged sales data entries with identical keys and aggregated the results into a new column, `number_of_sales`, representing the total count of merged rows.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Generated Data Columns:**\n",
    "   - Added columns to calculate values based on standard fuel and electricity prices:  \n",
    "     - **`dollars_to_work`**: Estimated commuting cost for a 20-mile round trip using $2.50 per gallon for gasoline and $0.13 per kWh for electricity.  \n",
    "     - **`co2_to_work`**: Calculated CO2 emissions for the same commute using coal-generated electricity (`kWh * 2.2 lbs CO2`).\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Commute Calculation Standards:**\n",
    "   - Calculated commute costs based on a 20-mile round trip, considering the negligible values for a single mile.  \n",
