Used meta_data_cleanup to modify the metadata for the vehicles.csv to be more readable and be able to be added to a dataframe if needed.

nan appears to be equivalent of gasoline fuel type in the atvtype field


List of possible needed columns. see columns to keep.txt

I need to verify what vehicle classes are available for EVs to perform the base comparisons among similar vehicle sizes.

Can look at fuel types available as time progresses.  Possibly fuel prices over the years.



fuelType column needs to be cleaned up as we are only looking at specific fuel types and electric.
Regular, Premium, Diesel, CNG, Gasoline or natural gas, Gasoline or E85, Electricity, Gasoline or propane, Premium or E85, Midgrade, Premium Gas or Electricity, Regular Gas and Electricity, Premium and Electricity, Regular Gas or Electricity, Hydrogen, 

prety sure this will be the varients we are looking for.
Regular, Premium, Electricity, Premium Gas or Electricity, Regular Gas and Electricity, Premium and Electricity, Regular Gas or Electricity,



120v charge time appears to only contain 2 numbers and will not be necessary for this project


My need to get gas pump avg fill time per gallon and vehicle gas tank sizes for a comparison on time to fill from empty.

For simplicity, I beleive I will only provide combined fuel mileage: comb08, combA08, combE, combinedCD, combinedUF, phevComb

-Co2 Emmissions, need to verify if columns have duplicate data, try to combine down to one column as vCo2Gpm. - may try estimated co2 production per mile driven
-condense fuel usage down to one column, vGasolineMpg - regardless of fuel types, use combined stats - gasoline per vehicle do the same with electric vElectricMpg
-combCD is charge depleting mode.  if it has a mpg not charge delpleting, may remove it as this is not necessary data, want to verify CD mpg if any.

LIST of columns and why and what I need to account for:

barrels, barrelsA08 : annual petroleum consumption.  may try to combine them in one column as this would apply to hybrids and gasoline engines
charge120/240 : charge 120 only has 2 values, remove if possible, 240 will give time to charge 
city08/08U / A08/A08U : may remove, this is city mileage for multiple fuel types rounded and unrounded - I intend to only use combided city/Hwy mileage.
cityCD : not sure if usable, may be when accounting for fuel consumption, but need combined not city, gas consumption, charge depleting mode on hybrids.



csv list of columns I think I need:
barrels, barrelsA08, charge240, co2, co2A, co2TailpipeGpm, co2TailpipeAGpm, comb08, combA08, combE, combinedCD, cylinders, 
displacement, drive, feScore, fuelCost08, fuelCostA08, fuelType, fuelType1, fuelType2, id, make, mfrCode, model, mpgData, 
phevBlended, range, rangeA, trans_dscr, trany, VClass, year, phevComb, baseModel 

EPA Fuel Economy
1 gallon of gasoline=33.7 kWh 

Due to (3) Unrounded MPG values are not available for some vehicles. I will clean all unrounded mpg columns
for simplicity I will probably do away with hybrid electric so only one fuel source per vehicle.

Need to remove all data not regular, premium, electric in these fields 'fuelType', 'fuelType1', 'fuelType2' - may need to remove fuel type 2 alltogether as only looking for electric or gasoline.
can remove all city and hwy mileage as I will focus on combined.

Look at hwyE as it may be used for single fuel electric vehicles but could be for duel fuel only

check highwayUF to verify if for electric only vehicles as well as hybrid
